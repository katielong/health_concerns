			<h2>Top 2 Health Concerns</h2>
			<p>This visualization was designed to explore the Top 2 health concerns among <a href="https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/impact/wicer/"><em>WICER</em></a> participants. There were a total of 3635 participants in this dataset. The respondents told us their Top 2 health concerns. </p>
			<p>The tickvalues counted the absolute number of participants who had answered the corresponding disease in their Top 1 concern. We observed that almost 1/3 of people listed cancer as their most concerned disease, and other major concerns included diabetes, cardiovascular problems and HTV-STD. The color of the circle's edge shows how the participants are divided between their Top 1 concerned disease.</p>
			<p>When we mouseover to each arc, we observe how this Top 1 concern is related to other Top 2 concerns. Each ribbon is colored by the dominant concern. For instance, the ribbon connected HIV-STD and Cancer is colored green. This is because among the people who have listed HIV-STD and Cancer as their Top 2 health concerns (regardless of order), more people listed Cancer as Top 1, which is why the ribbon is colored green. </p>
			<p>If a ribbon starts and ends at the same arc, it indicates that both Top 2 concerns are of the same category. For example, about 80 people listed cardiovascular diseases as both of thier Top 2 concerns.</p>
